Mostly based on good learning resource links I've come across on forums like reddit/news.ycombinator/etc

Resources include both [Computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) and [Computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming) and other stuff like tools, self care, etc
